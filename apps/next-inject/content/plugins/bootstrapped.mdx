import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout"

Bootstrap an existing Next.js project with Next Inject.

## Command

```bash
next-inject bootstrap
```

<Callout title="Info" type="info">
  The bootstrapping operation will take a few minutes if you don't have
  [shadcn-ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next) installed.
</Callout>

## Important Caveats

As of now, the following Next.js options must be configured to smoothly bootstrap your Next.js app.

Not following these steps could introduce errors in the injection process.

1. Make sure you create a TypeScript project, [JavaScript support](/plugins/javascript-support) is in the works.
2. Use the `src/` directory.
3. Use the **App Router**.
4. Use the default import alias `@/`.
