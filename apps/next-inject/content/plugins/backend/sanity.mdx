import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout"

## Usage

```bash
next-inject add sanity
```

## Setup Sanity Project

1. Create a [sanity account](https://www.sanity.io/login)
2. Create a new [sanity project](https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/projects)
3. Make sure to select "From scratch with CLI."

## Setup Environment Variables

1. Now we need to find your **projectId** and **dataset**.

- Your `projectId` should be on your new project page,
  and also in the URL as follows: https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/project/PROJECT_ID
- Your `dataset` should be available here: https://www.sanity.io/manage/personal/project/PROJECT_ID/datasets.
  By default it should be called **production**

2. Paste your **projectId** and **dataset** into your code as follows:

```ts title="src/sanity/env.ts"
export const apiVersion = "2024-07-31"

export const dataset = "YOUR_DATASET"

export const projectId = "YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
```

## Configure The Sanity CLI

1. Download the sanity CLI globally:

```package-install
npm install -g sanity@latest
```

2. Login with the sanity CLI:

```bash
sanity login
```

3. Deploy Sanity Studio locally for testing:

```bash
sanity dev
```

4. Once you are ready, you can now deploy your studio to the web:

```bash
sanity deploy
```
